# IcoNostr

The IcoNostr is a free-to-use set that includes icons in solid style, made exclusively for the Nostr Community, packaged as webfont for easy use.

You can add IcoNostr to your project by downloading the assets directly from Github or by CDN. Source SVG files are also available.

## Getting Started

How does it work? 

1. Start by downloading the package.
2. Add the ```fonts folder``` and ```iconostr.css``` file in your project main folder. 
3. Include the font stylesheet into the ```head``` of your page:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/iconostr.css">```

4. Add the nstr markup ```<i class="nstr-iconname"></i>```.


### CDN 
You can also use the icons by simply including the CDN link in the ```head``` of your page:

```html 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/quenquen/iconostr@main/iconostr.css"> 
``` 


## Using Icons

Display the icons by using classes on the ```<i>``` html tag. For example, you can use the ```nostr icon``` by using the following markup:

```<i class="nstr-nostr"></i>```
